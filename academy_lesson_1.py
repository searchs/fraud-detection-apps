"""
Define the problem in simple terms
Write the logical steps (physical steps) you would take to accomplish the task
Do the least amount of work necessary to accomplish the task - Never complicate solutions
If an activity is repeated more than once, write a function
Do not write what you don't need - e.g. what you think 'might' be useful in the future
Test. Test and again Test every step immediately
Refactor what you've done

Example:  Build a  Room booking platform
Problem:  Map room with time and people 
Constraint:  There should be no duplication
Steps:
Get a list of all rooms
Get a time frame for room availability
Get a list of users that can book the room
Receive a booking request [room, time]
Check if room is available - check booking status
Process booking status - return Booked or Available
Confirm room status to the user that made the request
